# sendanor/sstest

This is extremely simple unit testing implementation for JavaScript (and 
TypeScript).

It...

 * ...is less than 200 lines of code
 * ...has zero dependencies
 * ...does not need configuring
 * ...runs on Node v14 LTS and newer (but maybe older too)

Made from the frustration of setting up Mocha & etc for a new project, which 
also bring your project extra 109 packages as a dependency.

It took me less than an hour of work to implement it, which is much less than 
setting up working Mocha setup.
